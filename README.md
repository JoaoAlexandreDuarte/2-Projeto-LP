## Git repository

The work was made in a private repository that will be available publicly in this
[link](https://github.com/JoaoAlexandreDuarte/2-Projeto-LP) after the deadline.

## Task distribution

For this project, both Inês(es) didn't contribute to the making of the code, due to
inside problems.
So, they worked on the formal part of the work (report, UML, Fluxogram and comments).

* __Inês Nunes__
  * Wrote the report


* __João Duarte__
  * Wrote the whole code

## Our solution

### Architecture

The program was divided and organized using _classes_ and _enumerations_ for
easier understanding, and to ensure the code looks cleaner.

At launching, the game will show a menu screen, with four options.
When the player starts a new game, a level will be created using a
Random _class_.
The number of NPCs, Traps, Food and Weapons will be spawned according
to the Logistic method.
The method receives four parameters:
	x: the variable that defines the resulting value
	L: the maximum value of the curve
	x0: the value corresponding to the middle of the function's curve
	k: if the curves varies too quickly or not.
