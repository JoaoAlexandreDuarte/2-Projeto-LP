## Git repository

[link](https://github.com/JoaoAlexandreDuarte/2-Projeto-LP) after the deadline.

## Task distribution

For this project, both Inês(es) didn't contribute to the making of the code, due to
inside problems.
So, they worked on the formal part of the work (report, UML, Fluxogram and comments).

* __Inês Gonçalves__

* __Inês Nunes__
  * Wrote the report


* __João Duarte__
  * Wrote the whole code
